# Agricultural Connection AC 1.0: Digital Transformation in Agriculture

## Summary

During my time at Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, I worked on a project called Agricultural Connection AC 1.0. This project aimed to digitally transform the agricultural sector by developing a platform that connects farmers with e-commerce channels to streamline the sale of agricultural products. The project was supervised by Trần Minh Quang and involved collaboration with Nguyễn Huỳnh Anh Tú. Our goal was to create a user-friendly system that helps farmers manage their products, sales, and market demands more effectively.

## Skills and Technologies Used

### Data Integration and Management
- **MySQL**: For database management
- **Node.js and Express.js**: For backend development
- **API Integration**: With major e-commerce platforms like Tiki, Shopee, and Lazada

### Web Development
- **Frontend Development**: Using React.js and Bulma CSS framework
- **Backend Development**: Using Node.js and Express.js
- **Data Visualization and Reporting**


## Project Highlights

- **User Stories and Pain Points**: Addressed key challenges faced by farmers, such as financial constraints, market access, and process complexity.
- **System Design and Implementation**:
  - Developed user-friendly registration and login interfaces.
  - Created comprehensive dashboards for managing products, orders, and sales data.
